      <description>I am a Canadian graduate student studying at the University of Western Ontario.
In August 2018, I achieved a Master of Science in Psychology and currently, I am transitioning from cognitive psychology to a career in data analytics. I am enrolled in Ivey Business School&amp;rsquo;s MSc in Business Analytics (commencing January 2019).
My interests include research, statistical data analysis, and data visualization.
In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, cycling, SCUBA diving, birding as well as watching films and eSports.</description>
