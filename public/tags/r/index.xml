      <description>Earlier this year, I enrolled in a Data Management course as a part of my MSc in Business Analytics. The final project in this course involved presenting a business case for a database and building a MySQL database as a solution. As a squash enthusiast, I chose to base my project on the Professional Squash Association (PSA).
Long story short, I did not complete this project because it was cancelled due the spread of COVID-19.</description>

      <description>R Markdown R Markdown1 is a powerful R package that allows users to dynamically render their work (code, graphs, and text) into various file formats. Its wide range of outputs (including HTML, PDF, Word) makes it one of the most flexible and intuitive communication tools within the R community. Ultimately, R Markdown bridges the gap between data professionals and the audience they need to communicate to. In fact, I’m communicating to you right now through an R Markdown document rendered to HTML.</description>

      <description>I recently attended Edward Tufte’s course, “Presenting Data and Information”, in Boston. I learned about the course through twitter after reading about Tufte, who is a professor emeritus of political science and statistics at Yale.As a future business analytics student, I was very interested in a one day course taught by a data visualization expert. The most enticing factor was that it seemed to be the most design-focused course that I had read about.</description>

      <description>Melee! Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube was released in 2001. Since then, it has become one of the most adored games of the last twenty years. The game features many characters from various Nintendo game franchises, which players choose between before entering a match. The objective of each match is relatively simple: fight your opponent(s) and hit them beyond the boundaries of the stage. In contrast to fighting games, each time a player is struck they gain percentage points.</description>
