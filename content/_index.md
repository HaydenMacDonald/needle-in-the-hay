# Welcome
&nbsp;  
I am Hayden MacDonald and this is my technical blog.

### Why is your blog called "Needle in the Hay"?  
&nbsp;  
I chose <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/a-needle-in-a-haystack" target="_blank">"Needle in the Hay"</a> because it is an analogy for the diligent search for the right questions, among many *possible* questions, and their approximate answers, among all *possible* answers.  

My career mission is to use data analytics to sift through the "hay" in search of the "needle" when addressing new world business problems.

### What should I expect to see on this blog?  
&nbsp;  
My goal for this blog is to create quality content that documents my professional growth in programming and data analytics. My posts will contain educational content for myself and others, but may also contain personal reflections or opinions. Most of my posts will use the `R` programming language, but as I continue learning, I plan to include `Python` and `SQL` as well.
