## Welcome

I am Hayden MacDonald and this is my technical blog.

In August 2018, I achieved a Master of Science in Psychology from the University of Western Ontario. Currently, I am transitioning to a career in data analytics by attending Ivey Business School's MSc in Business Analytics.

#### Why is your blog called "Needle in the Hay"?

Usually, ["needle in the hay"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_in_a_haystack) is a figure of speech used to convey the impossibility, hopelessness or frustrating nature of a problem or objective. 

This is a bit bleak for my blog. 

I chose "Needle in the Hay" as the name for my blog because it is my analogy for the diligent search for the right questions, among many *possible* questions, and their approximate answers, among all *possible* answers. My career mission is to use the scientific method (i.e. data analytics) to sift through the "hay" in search of the "needle" when addressing new world business problems.

#### What should I expect to see on this blog?


My goal for this blog is to create quality content that documents my professional growth in programming and data analytics. My posts will contain educational content for myself and others, but may also contain personal reflection or opinions. Most of my posts will be based in *R*, but as I continue with my studies I plan to include python and SQL as well.
