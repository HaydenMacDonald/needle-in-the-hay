I am a Canadian graduate student studying at the University of Western Ontario.

In August 2018, I achieved a Master of Science in Psychology. Currently, I am transitioning to a career in data analytics through Ivey Business School's MSc in Business Analytics (commencing January 2019).  

My interests include research, statistical data analysis, and data visualization.  

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, cycling, SCUBA diving, birding as well as watching films and eSports.
