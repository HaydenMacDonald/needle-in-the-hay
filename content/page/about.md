I am a graduate student in Psychology at the University of Western Ontario. Currently, I am defending my Master's thesis in August 2018 and will be transitioning to study Business Analytics at Ivey Business School in 2019. 

My interests include research, statistical data analysis, and data visualization in R.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, cycling, SCUBA diving, birding as well as watching films and eSports.
