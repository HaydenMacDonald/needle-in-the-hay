<h2>A Project Salvaged <img src="/img/sticker.png" width="129" height="150" align="right" /></h2>
<p> <br />
Earlier this year, I enrolled in a Data Management course as a part of my MSc in Business Analytics. The final project in this course involved writing a business case study, designing a database model, and building a MySQL database. As a squash enthusiast, I chose to base my project on the Professional Squash Association (PSA). The business case was that if the PSA invested in a database, they could enrich the viewing experience for PSA TV subscribers.</p>
<p>Long story short, I did not complete this project because it was cancelled due the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had already put in approximately 20 hours of work into the project. Most of this work was a collection of R code used to scrape real data on PSA tournaments. So being as stubborn as I am, I committed to reusing the code by building an R package. The result is <code>squashinformr</code>: a package for scraping player, tournament, and ranking data from <a href="http://www.squashinfo.com/" target="_blank">SquashInfo</a>.<br />

<h2>Politeness on the web</h2>
<p> <br />
<code>squashinformr</code> is built on the <a href="https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite" target="_blank"><code>polite</code> package</a> and, therefore, inherits its principles on <a href="https://www.ddrive.no/post/be-nice-on-the-web/" target="_blank">“being nice on the web”</a>. In short, web scraping is a data collection method that can be harmful to websites and their users, if done carelessly. Therefore, it is important to use manners:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Seek permission to scrape before you begin.</li>
<li>Take slowly, so as to not be mistaken for a DDoS attack.</li>
<li>Never ask twice by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" target="_blank">memoization</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>squashinformr</code> abides by these principles to avoid causing harm to SquashInfo and its users. Following <code>polite</code> principles incurs mandatory delays (set by SquashInfo’s robotstxt files) on the scraping process. Therefore, it is important that users are patient when using <code>squashinformr</code>. SquashInfo currently offers full access to their data and extra features through a premium membership.

<h2>Functions in v0.1.0</h2>
<p> <br />
Generally, <code>squashinformr</code> functions fall into one of three families:<br />
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Player functions for scraping player profile data
<ul>
<li>get_players()</li>
<li>get_player_recent_results()</li>
<li>get_player_recent_matches()</li>
<li>get_player_recent_games()</li>
<li>get_player_rankings_history()</li>
<li>get_matchup()</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tournament functions for scraping tournament results data
<ul>
<li>get_tournaments()</li>
<li>get_tournament_players()</li>
<li>get_tournament_matches()</li>
<li>get_tournament_games()</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ranking functions for scraping current and historical rankings tables
<ul>
<li>get_rankings()</li>
<li>get_historical_rankings()</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
Let’s take a closer look at these functions in action…
